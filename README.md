# Project Title

Joke Compiler App


### Description

A joke creation app using a JavaScript library I developed that allows users to build a joke through an online form in english, spanish and french. The app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

The app works by allowing first allowing the user to select the language using a dropdown on the top of the page. From there the user is greeted in their language with the text of the website in that language. The user may now enter their joke configuration in the boxes on the form and submit to compile it into a joke for use at their next party, business lunch and more!

### Challenges or things learned while writing the app

1. I learned a great deal about AJAX and how jQuery works
2. I ran into some trouble while getting the app to production, but quickly pushed through them.
3. Having trouble with the responsive design of the application(planning on working through this)
4. Pushed through issue of how to display the values of the input fields in one output field at  the bottom of the page. I looked up solutions on StackOverflow and implemented it in the application.
